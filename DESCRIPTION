Description: Computes marginal conformal p-values using conformal prediction in binary classification tasks. Conformal prediction is a framework that augments machine learning algorithms with a measure of uncertainty, in the form of prediction regions that attain a user-specified level of confidence. This package specifically focuses on providing conformal p-values that can be used to assess the confidence of the classification predictions.
